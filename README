Special thanks to thn81, L42y, City-Busz, and all of the other AUR maintainers that helped make it possible to run Unity under Arch Linux!

Please make sure you don't already have modified versions of the dependencies installed. For example, gtk3-ubuntu might fail to compile if there's a modified version of gtk3 already installed.

Packages ending with "-ubuntu" contain Ubuntu patches and REPLACE Arch Linux versions of those packages.

* Optional packages

  - xfce4-indicator-plugin         => Ayatana indicators plugin for the XFCE panel
  - compizconfig-backend-kconfig4-ubuntu => Store Compiz settings in KConfig4
  - unity-core                     => For users that want Unity 2D, but not Unity 3D

All of PKGBUILD's were checked by namcap for consistency. The binary packages have not been checked yet.

Troubleshooting:

* Global menus aren't working when logging in with KDM (KDE display manager).

    This happens because previous versions of KDM weren't patched to source the
    /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ directory. This is fixed in kdebase-workspace
    version 4.7.2-1, but requires the KDM configuration files to be regenerated
    (resetting all KDM configuration options). To regenerate the configuration
    files, run as root

      # rm -rvf /usr/share/config/kdm
      # genkdmconf

* AHH! Something is wrong with Unity!

    Try resetting the settings for Unity and Compiz and relogin:

      $ rm -rvf ~/.compiz-1/
      $ rm -rvf ~/.cache/compizconfig-1/
      $ rm -rvf ~/.config/compiz-1/
      $ gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1
      $ gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compizconfig-1
      $ rm -rvf ~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/
      $ rm -rvf ~/.gconf/apps/compizconfig-1/
      $ rm -rvf ~/.cache/unity/
      $ rm -vf ~/.cache/unity-lens-video

    If something is still wrong, please file a bug report at either:

      https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch/issues

    or

* I have an ATI graphics card that needs the AMD Catalyst/fglrx driver.

    Use the xorg-server-ubuntu-1.11 package instead of xorg-server-ubuntu.

* qt-ubuntu does not build.

    Temporary remove the qtwebkit package (ignoring dependencies) by running:

      $ pacman -Rdd qtwebkit

    After the build, qtwebkit can be installed again.

* The global menu does not show up for Qt applications.

    Just install appmenu-qt :)

* System Settings (gnome-control-center) does not open.

    Just add the following line to ~/.xprofile and then log out and log back in
    (thanks to phinux!):

      export MALLOC_CHECK_=1
