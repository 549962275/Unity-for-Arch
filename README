Special thanks to thn81, L42y, City-Busz, and all of the other AUR maintainers that helped make it possible to run Unity under Arch Linux!

Please make sure you don't already have modified versions of the dependencies installed. For example, gtk3-ubuntu might fail to compile if there's a modified version of gtk3 already installed.

Packages ending with "-ubuntu" contain Ubuntu patches and REPLACE Arch Linux versions of those packages.

All of PKGBUILD's were checked by namcap for consistency. The binary packages have not been checked yet.

Troubleshooting:

Global menus aren't working when logging in with KDM (KDE display manager).

  This happens because previous versions of KDM weren't patched to source the
  /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/ directory. This is fixed in kdebase-workspace version
  4.7.2-1, but requires the KDM configuration files to be regenerated (resetting
  all KDM configuration options). To regenerate the configuration files, run as root

    # rm -rvf /usr/share/config/kdm
    # genkdmconf
